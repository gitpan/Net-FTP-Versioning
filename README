Net/FTP/Versioning version 0.01
===============================

Net::FTP::Versioning inherits all methods from Net::FTP and 
can be used in substitution of it. Extends the get() and put()
methods to add versioning support to them. 
A new transferTime() method was added to report the file transfer
time in seconds.

I use it to perform remote backups, and I enable versioning to rotate
the files previously backed up. This is better than simply overriding 
them each time a new transfer is made.
